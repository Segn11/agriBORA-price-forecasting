## 🌾 AgriBORA Commodity Price Forecasting Challenge

Ranked 51 / 358 competitors 🏅
Zindi Data Science Competition

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed for the AgriBORA Commodity Price Forecasting Challenge on Zindi.
The objective was to build a robust machine learning model capable of forecasting commodity prices using historical and structured economic data.

Commodity price prediction is a critical problem in agricultural economics, as accurate forecasts can help farmers, traders, and policymakers make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The task was to predict future commodity prices based on:

Historical pricing data

Market-related indicators

Structured tabular features

The evaluation metric used in the competition was:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Lower RMSE indicates better predictive performance.

## 🧠 My Approach
#1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed time-based trends and seasonality

Identified missing values and outliers

Studied correlation between features

Investigated distribution shifts

#2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Time-based features (lag features, rolling statistics)

Aggregation features

Handling missing values strategically

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling where necessary

Feature engineering played a significant role in improving model performance.

#3️⃣ Modeling Strategy

I experimented with multiple models including:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting

LightGBM (Final Model)

LightGBM provided the best balance between bias and variance and achieved the strongest leaderboard performance.

#📊 Model Optimization

Hyperparameter tuning

Cross-validation strategy

Feature selection

Iterative improvement based on validation scores

Each submission was carefully evaluated and refined to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
